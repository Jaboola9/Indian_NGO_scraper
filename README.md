# Indian NGO Scraper
*Summary*:

This is a Selenium webscraper designed to scrape all 88207 (as of 02/02/2020) NGO profiles from [India's official NGO-registry site](https://ngodarpan.gov.in/) using Selenium. I designed it as aid for research and is meant for **research purposes only!**

*Software requirements:*
[ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) - **chromedriver.exe** should be open in the same directory as the notebook and .py file.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.
